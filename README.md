### TUDelft Software Engineering Methods Project - PacMan ###
## Group 25 ##


The project consists of building a PacMan game, while following the correct code practices and rules of thumb.

## Members:

	Paul Adriaanse
		- Software Engineer : deals with GUI implementation and linkage between this and code logic

	Simran Karnani
		- Software Engineer : main GUI tasks and the game's windows

	Ruben Backx
		- Software Engineer : code logic implementation of the game board

	Filip Marchidan
		- Software Engineer : responsible with the database maintenance and functionality

	Alin Prundeanu
		- Software Engineer : game logic implementation and sprites movement tracking

 <h2> Our vision of the project :</h2>

 	We want to implement the original version of the PacMAn and from here, add some new features and perks in order to make it trully special. Along the way, we plan to follow closely the coding engineering rules regarding the layout of the project and the management of tasks, by making use of the AGILE approach, along with MOSCOW and SCRUM.

 <h2> Group contract </h2>
<ul>
<li>   We agree to follow the team social ethics, by respecting our team members and their work, ideas and suggestions and state our opinions in a logical and informative manner, with proper arguments and openess towards different mentalities regarding any subject.</li>
<li>   We agree to not be late on unofficial meetings without further notice and the time interval to not be over the common sense one.</li>
<li>   Regarding our coding procedures, we aggree to comply with other's coding style, as long as it follows the software engineering standards.</li>
<li>   We agree to treat the submitted pieces of code with their proper meaning, considering when something is not fully implemented that it might not be the current priority. Code changes often, which means some places need not to be implemented untill their proper time has come, in order to smoothly connect</li>
<li>   to the greater project's design.</li>
<li>   We agree to have each submitted piece of code approved by 2 other team developers that have not primarily contributed to the design of that specific code block. This way, we keep a fresh and diverse approach towards the project's evolution, with emphasis on contributing to the improvement of the code and not getting further in suggestions from the main required points.</li>
<li>   Ultimately, we agree to enjoy this project and have fun while completing it flawlessly.</li>
</ul>

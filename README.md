## Our vision of the project

We want to implement the original version of the PacMan and from here, add some new features and perks in order to make it trully special. Along the way, we plan to follow closely the coding engineering rules regarding the layout of the project and the management of tasks, by making use of the AGILE approach, along with MoSCoW and SCRUM.
